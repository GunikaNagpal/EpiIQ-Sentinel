##  The Problem

Most epidemic dashboards show you a number like cases, deaths, a map coloured by severity. You see a red country. **So what?**

They don't tell you *why* it's red, whether neighbours are at risk, what happens if vaccination drops, or where the outbreak will be in two weeks.

**EpiIQ Sentinel** answers the four questions that actually matter to public health decision-makers:

| Question | Module |
| 📍 **WHERE** is the outbreak — is it spreading across borders? | Spatial analysis 
| ⏱️ **WHEN** did the outbreak change and why? | Structural break detection + variant attribution |
| 📈 **WHAT** will happen in the next 14 days? | ARIMA / Prophet forecasting |
| 🧠 **WHY** is this country high risk? | SHAP explainability in biological language |
